CRDA
-----

This is the Central Regulatory Domain Agent effort.

Primative diagram:

Db --> Fdb
D can read Fdb
K queries D, D reads Fdb, D passes an R to the Kernel
K enforces R

Legend:

Db: MySQL database
Fdb: File database
D: CRDA Daemon
K: The Linux kernel
R: A regulatory domain structure built by D and passed to the K

Phase I
--------
For now we will build a MySQL database with some temporary data to populate the database
and a script to extract this into a file, Fdb. Proper regulatory information is coming.

Phase II
--------
Userspace CRDA daemon which can read Fdb, and given a country outputs a regulatory domain
definition for that country.

Phase III
---------
Add nl80211 commands and attributes in the kernel to handle receiving a regulatory domain
structure from the CRDA daemon.

Phase IV
--------
Test with a driver, zd1211rw.
