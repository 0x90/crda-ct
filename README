CRDA
-----

This is the Central Regulatory Domain Agent effort.

Primative diagram:

Db --> Fdb
D can read Fdb (regulatory.bin)
K queries D, D reads Fdb, D passes an R to the Kernel
K enforces R

Legend:

Db: text file (db.txt)
Fdb: binary database (defined in daemon/regdb.h)
D: CRDA Daemon
K: The Linux kernel
R: A regulatory domain structure built by D and passed to the K

Phase I
--------
We parse the text file database db.txt into the binary database that
tools (including the daemon) should use.

Example C code to read Fdb is available as daemon/dump.c.

Phase II
--------
Userspace CRDA daemon which can read Fdb, and given a country outputs a regulatory domain
definition for that country.

Phase III
---------
Add nl80211 commands and attributes in the kernel to handle receiving a regulatory domain
structure from the CRDA daemon.

Phase IV
--------
Test with a driver, zd1211rw.
